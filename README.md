# cli-epp
Pick your AMD P-State EPP power preference with this redundant tool!

# Requirements
Ensure that you have:
* Installed the latest version of python on your linux distribution,
* Given executable permissions to the main.py file,
* Are using AMD P-State EPP compatible hardware with a compatible linux kernel.

# Notes
It may be ideal to place main.py in your ~/Scripts/ directory, or similar, and alias its execution accoridngly in a ~/.bash_aliases file, or similar, via:
> alias='sudo python ./path/to/script/main.py'
The latter will allow the script to conveniently function in your terminal of choice.
